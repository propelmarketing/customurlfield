This is a Django URLField model field.

It takes a default protocol, (if not supplied, is http)
and a list of other protocols.
It then splits the url by "://", and if there is no protocol, it prepends http:// to the url.
If there is a protocol, it will check to make sure it is accepted. If it is, everything validates.
If it is not, it throws a ValidationError.





Example:

from django.db import models
from customurlfield.fields import URLField


class TestModel(models.Model):
    customurl = URLField(default_protocol="http",protocols=["https","ssh","spdy"])
                         # protocols must be a list.
                         # accepts http, https, ssh, and spdy for a url.
